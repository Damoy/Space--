Escape and/or kill the zombies and solve the labyrinth !


------------------

Hey !

Here is my Ludum Dare 40th compo entry that I made in about 15 hours.<br>
The theme was "The more you have, the worse it is."<br>
The idea was that the map becomes bigger and bigger but your move possibilities fewer and fewer :)<br><br>
Hope you'll have some fun !<br>
